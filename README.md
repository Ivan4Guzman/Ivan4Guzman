## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Iâ€™m a junior Python developer currently diving into the world of data analysis using two of Pythonâ€™s most powerful librariesâ€”Pandas and NumPy. This repository is a space where I share my learning journey, personal projects, and experiments as I build a solid foundation in working with data.

My focus right now is on understanding how to manipulate, clean, and explore datasets using Pandas, and how to leverage NumPy for efficient numerical operations. Iâ€™m learning how to load data, handle missing values, filter and sort rows, compute statistics, and reshape data into meaningful formats. At the same time, Iâ€™m exploring NumPy arrays to perform vectorized operations, understand broadcasting, and get comfortable with working at scale.

This repository includes notebooks, scripts, and small projects that reflect real-world problems and datasetsâ€”from analyzing CSV files to building simple data pipelines. Each project is an opportunity for me to apply new concepts, reinforce what Iâ€™ve learned, and share progress in an open and transparent way.

If youâ€™re also learning data analysis with Python, feel free to explore the code, clone a project, or leave feedback. I believe in learning by doing, and I hope this space can be useful to others who are also just getting started. Whether you're brushing up on your skills or stepping into the data world for the first time, thereâ€™s something here for you.

Thanks for stopping by! Iâ€™m excited to keep building, learning, and sharing more as I grow in the field of data analysis with Python.
